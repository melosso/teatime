The quickest way to run Teatime is the published container image, which has everything bundled and ready. If you would rather host on Windows, a ready to run build ships with every release.

## Docker

Create a `docker-compose.yml` next to your writing:

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
services:
  teatime:
    image: ghcr.io/melosso/teatime:latest
    container_name: teatime
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./content:/app/content
```

Mount your own `content/` folder holding your `.md` files and an optional `config.json`. When that is in place, bring it up:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Your blog is then waiting at `http://localhost:8080`. For running it as a long lived service, the [Docker Compose notes](/deploy/containers/) go a little further.

## Windows and IIS

Each release ships a ready to run build for Windows:

1. Download the latest `*-Windows_x64.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/melosso/teatime/releases){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} page.
2. Extract it into your site folder, for example `C:\inetpub\teatime`.
3. Create an IIS site pointed at that folder, with the CLR version set to "No Managed Code".
4. Make sure the [.NET 11 Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/11.0){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is installed.
5. Start the site and browse to it.

The zip already includes a `web.config` wired for in process hosting, so no manual edits are needed. A `*-Linux_x64.zip` build is attached to each release as well, though we have yet to document this installation process.
